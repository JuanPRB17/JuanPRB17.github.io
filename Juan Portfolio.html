    <h1>Juan Pablo Ramirez Barajas Portfolio</h1>
    <br>
   <p>It took me a while to find out what I wanted to do, all I knew is that I wanted
    to create. I graduated highschool in 2017 and looking back the same thing kept popping
    back in my mind and that was wanting to create my own apps exactly how I wanted them.
   </p> 
   <br>
   <p>When I first started coding it was very overwhelming but seeing all the possiblities
    it peaked my intrest!
